**Question:** um i had a question related to the concentration practice. how does one know when they should let go of a single object and allow the attention to move to other objects. so if you if you're practicing concentration to make the moment peaceful then what is it you're thinking of moving to.

well i was i was just on a retreat and my attention began moving to objects very quickly and there was an ability of mindfulness or a faculty to know that where it was moving so it just kind of started happening naturally where the object of my concentration was the whole body and that be that began kind of dissolving and the attention began moving to different parts back


**Answer:** if you're thinking of concentration only then you just remain with your meditation object say for example if it's the breath or something whatever your object is you just remain with that. If the mind is trying to go out to other things and you must be bringing it back. If you keep allowing the mind to move out to other places or move through the body then it's like your mindfulness is beginning to spread and your and your concentration will grow and deepen what. It is because the purpose of meditation of focusing your awareness upon a meditation object that is suited to you you're doing so so as to try and bring the mind and to make the mind one pointed. Once the mind feels one pointed and you're trying to develop wisdom, allowing the attention to move to multiple objects to allow insight to arise of the impermanent nature of all things. So is this okay at that point and then you allow the mind to actually investigate the body what's happening in the body to see the impermanence and absence of self within the body then yes this can be used to develop wisdom.

give rise to wisdom when it comes to focusing on the body then you must be using your mindfulness and wisdom to actually probe quite deeply into the body it's not just like seeing feelings superficially on the body you have to be penetrating in there trying to break the body down to see either the inherent unattractiveness like these are super contemplations or breaking the body down into like these four elements or into the parts of the body to see what what is actually the body comprised of and is it impermanent and not self investigating the body like this is this is what gives rise to wisdom

in a follow-up question on the contemplation of the body i was able to see when the body broke down it began to break down into particles and the particles you could i could see the um the different elements in different particles is what is enough um in terms of the elements in order to um get rid of the defilements. How much do you need to see foreign when it comes to letting go of the mental defilements it's not like you just see it clearly once and then the mind makes good quite often you have to see it many many times and then the mind eventually keeps gradually letting go into it it's understanding mature enough that it lets go so you have to see it you have to see it often reflect on the body say once and see it clearly and then stop your reflection on the body so having seen it once and the mind is peaceful it may it may wish to to put down body contemplation for a while and just rest but then at other times you must make the mind contemplate the body and just frequently see the true nature of the body.

it's just like if you're eating a meal if you have 10 mouthfuls and you're not full then you keep eating more and you have like maybe 20 and you're still not full you're going to 30 to 40 but then when you're full you know and you put the string down and you put your knife and fork down and it's the same letting go of the kilesas. and it's just the same as developing wisdom to let go of attachment towards the body contemplating the body you just do it frequently and then when one spiritual faculties are matured enough, once faculties are matured enough, once understanding of the nature of the body is mature enough for that level of practice then it will naturally let go of its attachment at that time
