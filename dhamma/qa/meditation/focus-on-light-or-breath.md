**Question:** there is light my attention will be drawn to the light and go deeper into it. may i when this happens may i stop paying attention to the rising and cessation of my breath. should my meditation object be on the light or on the breath please advice thank you.

**Answer:** normally in the practice of meditation, we'll be focusing upon the breath. however if uh this brightness or this bright light arises within your mind and you focus upon that you see that this is you're able to make your mind peaceful then you can actually change your focus to that. and when the brightness diminishes then you can return to your breath.
